## Overview
Asteroid Remake is a simple 2D space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship and must avoid asteroids while shooting them down to earn points. The game ends when the player loses all their lives.

## Features
- **Spaceship Movement**: The player can move the spaceship left and right using arrow keys.
- **Shooting**: The player can shoot bullets by pressing the spacebar.
- **Asteroids**: Falling asteroids that the player must avoid or shoot to earn points.
- **Power-Ups**: Collect heart-shaped power-ups that give extra lives.
- **Score and Lives**: The game tracks the player's score and lives. Each asteroid destroyed gives points, and collisions with asteroids reduce lives.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays the final score when the player loses all lives.

## Game Classes
- **Player**: Manages the spaceship's movement and shooting functionality.
- **Asteroid**: Controls the behavior of asteroids (movement and collision detection).
- **Bullet**: Manages the bullets fired by the player.
- **Power-Up**: Provides power-ups that give the player extra lives when collected.

## How to Play
1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship.
2. Press the spacebar to shoot bullets.
3. Destroy asteroids to gain points and avoid losing lives.
4. Collect heart-shaped power-ups to gain extra lives.

## Installation
1. Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Pygame:  
   Run the following command in your terminal:  
   pip install pygame


## Conclusion
Developing this Asteroid Remake game was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It required integrating various elements such as player movement, shooting mechanics, collision detection, and game state management. Implementing features like power-ups, asteroid randomness, and handling game-over conditions added complexity, making the project both fun and educational.

One of the main challenges was finding the right resources and documentation to understand Pygame's capabilities fully. There were many online tutorials, forums, and the official Pygame documentation that helped guide the development process. While Pygame offers great flexibility, understanding how to combine all the different components into a smooth, functional game took considerable time and effort.

Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of game development concepts, object-oriented programming, and Pygame, and I look forward to continuing to improve and expand on this game in the future.
